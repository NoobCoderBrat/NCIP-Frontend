                        access to health care. The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2007 (UNDRIP) states that 
                        Indigenous Peoples have the right to improvement of their economic and social conditions without 
                        discrimination; develop priorities and strategies for exercising their right to development; right to

                        <strong>Gender and Rights-based Services</strong><br />
                        This sub-program covers strategic efforts to protect the rights of the Indigenous Peoples to 
                        self-governance and self-determination ensuring that, but not limited to the following
                        The socio-political structures, systems and institutions of ICCs/IPs are strengthened;
                        The Indigenous structures, systems and institutions are not supplanted by other forms of 
                        non-indigenous governance; and/or The established mechanisms that allow the interfacing of 
                        Indigenous systems of governance with the national systems are established; and

                        <strong>IP Rights Advocacy and Monitoring of Treaty Obligations</strong><br />
                        The advocacy and monitoring of treaty obligations regarding Indigenous Peoples' (IPs) rights are 
                        crucial in ensuring their basic human rights are respected and upheld. IPs have historically existed 
                        as distinct societies with their own governance, territories, and cultural identities prior to foreign 
                        colonization in the Philippines. Recognizing IPs' collective rights as well as their individual rights 
                        within the larger Philippine society is essential. The IP Human Rights Program, developed in consultation 
                        with IPs, aims to support the Commission by promoting the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA) as a 
                        national framework for IP rights, advocating for ancestral domains as peaceful territories for 
                        self-determined development, and enhancing coordination and monitoring mechanisms at all levels. 
                        The program's objectives include ensuring the recognition, protection, and promotion of IPs' social, 
                        political, cultural, and economic rights, emphasizing that IPs' rights are human rights, and fostering 
                        the self-determined development and security of IPs and their ancestral domains.<br /><br />
                        <strong>IP Education and Advocacy Services</strong><br />
                        The IP Education and Advocacy Services consist of three primary programs aimed at supporting 
                        Indigenous Peoples (IPs) in their educational pursuits. The Educational Assistance Program (EAP) 
                        provides financial support to qualified IP students based on specific criteria outlined in NCIP 
                        guidelines. The Merit-Based Scholarship Program (MBSP) awards scholarships to deserving IP students 
                        based on strict screening criteria. Additionally, the Support and Advocacy Program complements the 
                        EAP and MBSP by offering various education-related initiatives, such as Licensure Examination for 
                        Teachers, bridging programs, health programs, social infrastructures, and culturally appropriate 
                        education trainings and research. Together, these programs strive to facilitate the educational 
                        advancement and holistic development of IPs.<br /><br />
